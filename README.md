Hands-on Tree-based Algorithms TrainingTechnical Note from Scratch (in Python)

The High Energy Physics (HEP) community has been developing dedicated solutions for processing experiment data over decades. However, with recent advancements in Big Data, Automated Machine Learning, GPU acceleration, and Cloud (CPU & GPU) Services, a question of application of such technologies in the domain of HEP data analysis becomes relevant. As the first part of our trilogy of the Alchemists Handbook, we present our experience with tree-based algorithms training that combines the data extraction, feature engineering, automated learning, and data visualization based on the off-the-shelf frameworks, services, and tools. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) present in this technote is based on the CERN Open Data, but it can be decoupled entirely from the experiment, or in other words, it can be coupled/employed with any other HEP experiments. We also provide an interactive web-based interface based on Jupiter Notebooks as the main entry-point for the potential users.
